HorizontalBarChart: `key` is not a prop. Trying to access it will result in `undefined` being returned. If you need to access the same value within the child component, you should pass it as a different prop.

              <HorizontalBarChart key={rndKey} objectId='QQVDL' app={app} onBarPointClick={handleBarPointClick} />
